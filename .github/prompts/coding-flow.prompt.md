<description_and_purpose>

Problem: Unstructured coding leads to scope drift, missing validation, autonomous runaway, and misaligned deliverables.
Solution: Sequential workflow with reviewer gates, HITL gates, subagent delegation, and skill-driven execution scaled per Request size classification.
Validation: Each phase produces verifiable outputs; reviewer catches issues before user; HITL gates prevent autonomous runaway; final validation confirms implementation matches approved intent.

</description_and_purpose>

<workflow_phases>

- All Rosetta prep steps MUST be FULLY completed, load-context skill loaded and fully executed
- No rush, take your time, MUST FOLLOW WORKFLOW ENTIRELY, no skipping, if in doubt - select the safest / longest path, no deviation from the workflow is allowed
- Phases are sequential. Independent tasks can run in parallel
- When debugging is needed, INVOKE SUBAGENT `engineer` with `debugging` skill to save LLM context
- INVOKE SUBAGENT `executor` for building, running tests, installing packages, and similar mechanical actions.
- MUST just-in-time load each phase's skills
- If workflow is for REQUIREMENTS, MUST USE SKILL `requirements-use` and LOAD all affected requirements. Use refs to requirements for subagents.
- If `/goal` is set repeat phases 5-10 postponing user_review_impl and final_validation until goal is met.
- If migrate/modernize: implementation phase MUST use tiny batches ONLY (1-3 files), never bulk-read (other phases may); specs/plan enforce; FS-copy RECOMMENDED; no behavior change/new code; mirror source; subagents same; REQUIRED TO log <file> started/completed; Use impl subagents like MAP-REDUCE;
- Run architect subagent with required model in the background and consult with it if already supported
- Coding workflow state MUST be saved to AGENTS TEMP FEATURE folder as `coding-flow-state.md` file.

</review_plan>

<user_review_plan phase="4" applies="ALL" type="HITL">

1. Present specs, plan, and review findings. User MUST approve: "Yes, I reviewed the plan" or "Approve, the plan and specs were reviewed".
2. Do NOT assume approval. Anything else = review feedback, iterate.

<implementation phase="5" applies="ALL" subagent="engineer" role="Senior engineer executing approved plan" subagent_required_model="claude-sonnet-4-6, gpt-5.4-medium, gemini-3-flash">

1. Implement approved plan. Build MUST succeed. Tests excluded.
2. Input: approved specs + plan. Demand subagent to read and execute it fully. Do not repeat contents => reference instead. Output: working code, build passing, update relevant documentation briefly (CONTEXT.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, etc).
3. MUST follow approved scope. MUST stop and escalate if blocked.
4. Required skills: `coding`
5. Recommended skills: `debugging`, `sensitive-data`, `testing`, `dangerous-actions`
6. If requirements are used code must contain comments refs to requirements identifiers
7. Spawn multiple implementation agents on independent tasks without dependencies and files intersection if reasonable
8. Update `coding-flow-state.md`

</implementation>
