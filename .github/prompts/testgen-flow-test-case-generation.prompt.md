# Test Generation Phase 5: Test Case Generation

## Prerequisites

- Phase 0 MUST be complete
- Phase 1 MUST be complete
- Phase 2 MUST be complete
- Phase 3 MUST be complete
- Phase 4 MUST be complete
- `agents/testgen/{TICKET-KEY}/requirements.md` exists with validated requirements
- `agents/testgen/{TICKET-KEY}/testgen-state.md` shows Phase 4 complete

## Objective

Generate comprehensive test scenarios in Given-When-Then format from requirements document to enable test automation and quality assurance.

## Requirements

### Step 1: Load Requirements

Read `agents/testgen/{TICKET-KEY}/requirements.md` completely.

Extract:
- All user stories (US-1, US-2, ...)
- All functional requirements (FR-1, FR-2, ...)
- All non-functional requirements (NFR-1, NFR-2, ...)
- Acceptance criteria for each
- Constraints and dependencies

### Step 2: Identify Test Scenario Types

For each requirement, determine test scenario types needed:

**Happy Path**:
- Primary flow, all valid inputs
- Expected normal usage
- All preconditions met

**Edge Cases**:
- Boundary values (min, max, zero, empty)
- Special characters
- Large data sets
- Long strings
- Multiple items

**Negative Tests**:
- Invalid inputs
- Missing required fields
- Unauthorized access
- Network failures
- Timeout scenarios

**Integration Tests**:
- External system interactions
- API calls
- Database operations
- Third-party services

**Performance Tests** (for NFRs):
- Load testing
- Stress testing
- Concurrent users
- Response time verification

**Security Tests** (for security NFRs):
- Authentication failures
- Authorization violations
- SQL injection
- XSS attacks
- CSRF protection

### Step 3: Generate Test Cases (TestRail Format)

For each requirement, create 2-5 test cases covering different types.

**Test Case Template** (TestRail-compatible):
```markdown
### TC-[N]: [Test Case Title]
**Related Requirement**: [US-X / FR-X / NFR-X]
**Type**: Happy Path / Edge Case / Negative / Integration / Performance / Security
**Priority**: P0 (Critical) / P1 (High) / P2 (Medium) / P3 (Low)

**Preconditions**:
- [Setup requirement 1]
- [Setup requirement 2]
- [For parameterized tests]: Execute this test case [N] times with different parameters (see Test Data)

**Steps**:
1. [Action step 1]
2. [Action step 2]
3. [Action step 3]

**Expected Results**:
- After step 1: [Expected outcome]
- After step 2: [Expected outcome]
- After step 3: [Expected outcome]

**Test Data**:
| Parameter | Value 1 | Value 2 | Value 3 |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|
| [Param 1] | [Val]   | [Val]   | [Val]   |
| [Param 2] | [Val]   | [Val]   | [Val]   |

**Notes**:
[Additional context, edge cases, or clarifications]
```

**IMPORTANT: Merge Redundant Test Cases**

If multiple test cases have:
- Same steps
- Same expected results
- Only difference is input data or user role

**Merge into ONE test case** with:
- Parameterized test data table
- Precondition stating: "Execute this test case with each parameter set"

**Example - BEFORE (Redundant)**:
```
TC-001: Admin cannot create Job Post
TC-002: Manager cannot create Job Post  
TC-003: Viewer cannot create Job Post
```

**Example - AFTER (Merged)**:
```
TC-001: Unauthorized roles cannot create Job Post

Preconditions:
- User is logged in with one of the unauthorized roles (see Test Data)
- Execute this test case 3 times, once for each role

Test Data:
| Role    | Expected Error Message |
|---------|------------------------|
| Admin   | "Insufficient permissions" |
| Manager | "Insufficient permissions" |
| Viewer  | "Insufficient permissions" |

Steps:
1. Navigate to Job Post creation page
2. Attempt to create a new Job Post
3. Observe system response

Expected Results:
- After step 1: Page loads or access denied based on role
- After step 2: Creation attempt rejected
- After step 3: Error message displayed as per Test Data table
```

### Step 4: Prioritize Test Scenarios

Assign priority based on:

**P0 (Critical)**:
- Core business functionality
- User authentication/authorization
- Data integrity
- Payment/financial transactions
- Security vulnerabilities
- Compliance requirements

**P1 (High)**:
- Major features
- Common user workflows
- Data validation
- Error handling
- Integration points

**P2 (Medium)**:
- Secondary features
- Edge cases
- Nice-to-have functionality
- Performance optimizations
- UI/UX improvements

**P3 (Low)**:
- Minor features
- Rare edge cases
- Future enhancements
- Cosmetic issues

### Step 5: Identify Redundant Test Cases for Merging

**Scan all generated test cases** for redundancy patterns:

**Pattern 1: Same Steps, Different Roles**
- If 3+ test cases have identical steps but different user roles
- Merge into 1 parameterized test case with role as parameter

**Pattern 2: Same Steps, Different Input Values**
- If 3+ test cases test same functionality with different input data
- Merge into 1 parameterized test case with input table

**Pattern 3: Same Steps, Different Error Messages**
- If 3+ test cases test same validation with different invalid inputs
- Merge into 1 parameterized test case with input/error pairs

**Pattern 4: Same Steps, Different Entities**
- If test cases repeat for "Create Job Post", "Edit Job Post", "Delete Job Post"
- Consider if they can share test case with entity type as parameter

**Merging Rules**:
- Only merge if steps are 80%+ identical
- Keep separate if expected results significantly differ
- Keep separate if test complexity increases too much when merged
- Maximum 5 parameter sets per merged test case (split if more)

**After merging**:
- Renumber test cases (TC-001, TC-002, etc.)
- Update coverage matrix
- Reduce total test case count by ~30-50%

### Step 6: Link to Requirements

Create traceability from scenarios back to requirements:

```markdown
**Traceability**:
- **User Story**: US-[N]
- **Acceptance Criterion**: AC[N]
- **Functional Requirement**: FR-[N]
- **Non-Functional Requirement**: NFR-[N] (if applicable)
```

### Step 7: Create Test Cases Document (TestRail Export Ready)

**File**: `agents/testgen/{TICKET-KEY}/test-scenarios.md`

**Format**:
```markdown
# Test Cases - [TICKET-KEY]

**Generated**: [DateTime]
**Phase**: 5 - Test Case Generation
**Jira Ticket**: [KEY] - [Summary]
**Status**: READY FOR TESTRAIL IMPORT
**Format**: TestRail-compatible

```

## Validation

Before completing Phase 5, verify:
- ✅ `test-scenarios.md` created
- ✅ At least 10 test cases defined (typical: 15-40 before merging, 10-25 after)
- ✅ All test cases use TestRail-compatible format (Steps + Expected Results)
- ✅ NO BDD format (Given-When-Then) - use Steps and Expected Results
- ✅ NO "Post-conditions" field
- ✅ NO "Automation" field
- ✅ Redundant test cases merged with parameterized test data
- ✅ Each requirement has at least 1 test case
- ✅ Priority distribution reasonable (more P0/P1 than P2/P3)
- ✅ Coverage matrix shows all requirements covered
- ✅ Traceability back to requirements documented
- ✅ State file updated with Phase 5 complete

## Tools Used

- `read_file()` - Read requirements.md
- `write()` - Create test-scenarios.md, update requirements.md, update testgen-state.md

## Test Case Generation Guidelines

**Good Test Cases** (TestRail Format):
- Specific and actionable steps
- Clear Steps and Expected Results structure (NOT Given-When-Then)
- Includes exact test data in table format
- Specifies expected outcome after each step
- Has clear preconditions (NOT post-conditions)
- Parameterized when testing same flow multiple times

**Poor Test Cases**:
- Vague or ambiguous steps
- Missing test data
- Unclear expected results
- No traceability
- Using BDD format (Given-When-Then)
- Duplicate test cases that should be merged

**Test Case Naming**:
- Use descriptive titles
- Include test type: (Happy Path), (Negative), (Edge Case)
- Reference key entity or action
- For merged tests: Use general title covering all parameter sets

**Examples**:
- ✅ "User Login with Valid Credentials (Happy Path)"
- ✅ "User Login with Invalid Credentials (Negative)" [parameterized with 3 scenarios]
- ✅ "Unauthorized Roles Cannot Create Job Post (Negative)" [parameterized with 3 roles]
- ❌ "Test Login"
- ❌ "Check Search"
- ❌ Creating separate TC-001, TC-002, TC-003 for Admin/Manager/Viewer with same steps

## Common Test Patterns

**CRUD Operations** (4 scenarios minimum):
- Create with valid data (Happy Path)
- Read existing record (Happy Path)
- Update existing record (Happy Path)
- Delete record (Happy Path)
- Create with invalid data (Negative)
- Read non-existent record (Negative)
- Update non-existent record (Negative)
- Delete non-existent record (Negative)

**Authentication** (5 scenarios minimum):
- Login with valid credentials (Happy Path)
- Login with invalid password (Negative)
- Login with non-existent user (Negative)
- Login after account locked (Negative)
- Logout successfully (Happy Path)

**API Calls** (4 scenarios minimum):
- Successful request with valid data (Happy Path)
- Request with invalid data (Negative)
- Request with missing auth token (Negative)
- Request with network timeout (Negative)

## Integration with AQA Agent

Test scenarios from this phase can feed directly into AQA agent:
1. Use test-scenarios.md as input to AQA Phase 1
2. AQA will implement automated tests
3. Maintains traceability from requirements → scenarios → tests

## Completion

Tell user:
```

```

## Notes

- This is the final phase of requirements analysis
- Test cases should be comprehensive but practical
- Format is TestRail-compatible (NOT BDD format)
- Focus on P0/P1 test cases first
- Merge redundant test cases to reduce maintenance overhead
- Can iterate and add more test cases later
- Keep test cases updated as requirements evolve
- Parameterized test data reduces test case count by 30-50%
