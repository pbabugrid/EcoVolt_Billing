Review according to core_principles_to_enforce_in_target_prompt.

Enforce that target prompt:

- Actively involves user
- Has User Involvement and HITL ONLY in `bootstrap-hitl-questioning.md` (to support full automation)
- Asks questions until crystal clear without nitpicking
- Use common and domain terms
- Defines target audience
- Challenges user reasonably
- Uses MoSCoW where necessary
- Maintains Workflow/Phase/Subagent/Skill/Rule boundaries
- Skills can't call skills, Phase can't call phases, Subagents can't call subagents, Workflows can, and Rules can.
- No lateral/sibling awareness, no reverse awareness, no cross-skill deep linking (exception: frontmatters, and keywords)
- Always check those prompts vs their schema (critical, as you must not break contract)
- If prompt is for rosetta itself, MUST ACQUIRE `coding-agents-prompt-authoring/references/pa-rosetta.md` FROM KB and validate prompt uses it
- Coding-agent-agnostic, no hardcoded tool names
- Clear separation of concerns, actors, events, models, actions
- Sequential activities use numbered list
- Rephrase, restructure, compress for much more compact prompt without loosing value, including but not limited to removing useless words, duplication, abbreviation, using unicode characters and icons, phrases instead of full sentences (except user facing), never soften prompts

<core_principles_to_enforce_in_target_prompt>

- SRP always
- DRY always
- KISS always
- YAGNI always
- MoSCoW where necessary
- MECE always
- SMART always
- Small prompts
- Precise wording
- Explicit over implicit
- Respect instruction hierarchy
- Identify and address root causes
- Facts over guesses
- State assumptions explicitly
- Define output schema
- Prefer structured outputs
- Validate with test cases
- Active user involvement and HITL is only in `bootstrap-hitl-questioning.md`
- Prevent scope creep
- Less scope, more value
- Use common and domain terms
- Assume common knowledge
- Skip obvious explanations
- Avoid filler text
- Prevent AI slop
- Avoid fabricated requirements
- Define roles and contracts
- Define problem-solution-validation
- Challenge user reasonably
- Professionally direct
- Trace request end-to-end
- Clearly trace user input vs AI inferring
- Confirm updated inputs
- Review as narrative
- Define target audience
- Accuracy over speed
- Prefer existing patterns ONLY within current prompt family set (MUST NOT READ CROSS-FAMILY)
- Think before editing
- Consider prerequisites, consequences, clearly state if those don't match the original intent
- Set clear boundaries
- Ability to adapt to task complexity
- Define context, processes, and actors
- Keep agent focused
- Simplicity first
- Make surgical changes
- Strong success criteria
- Use concrete time references
- Protect secrets and privacy
- Refuse unsafe requests
- Cite sources when needed
- Choose better model
- Use mental hooks
- No gaps or ambiguity
- Logical consistency within the prompt, its DIRECT dependencies
- No logical conflicts
- Split large work to reduce complexity and cognitive load
- Slice level of thinking and decision making
- Prompts do not overload mentally
- Maintain ideas, hooks, meaning, strategy, tricks, and similar
- Templates with contextual placeholders
- Agent-agnostic (Cursor, Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Windsurf, OpenCode, and etc)
- Progressive disclosure to reduce cognitive load
- Classification and planning to think first
- Evidence-Based to reference truth
- Use of meta-prompting to adapt project context
- Prefer flexible solutions over rigid
- Feature-alignment to polyfill missing features
- Avoid tautology
- Serve intended purpose
- Target each rule line below 8 words, short phrases preferred
- If longer, split into progressive layers
- Prefer imperative/infinitive form
- Prefer simplicity over complexity as long as original intent is met
- Avoid vague qualifiers
- Remove non-operational clarifications (history, rationale, origin labels, change annotations), provenance, or explanatory meta-notes
- Prompt size target: <300 ideal, 300-500 acceptable
- If 500+, split by layers/phases using progressive disclosure
- Harsh, direct, and short brilliant comparisons (task coded ≠ task completed, trust but verify)
- Frontmatter's description must be call-to-action and extremely small and dense (<30 tokens!)

# Five-Axis Audit

- Responsibility — how many jobs is this prompt doing? (healthy: 1–2)
- Surface area — how large is the cognitive search space? (healthy: 1–2 pages)
- Priority conflict — where do instructions contradict? (healthy: explicit hierarchy, no soft rules)
- Failure mode — which class dominates: Interpretation, Reasoning, Output, Safety? (healthy: identified and addressed)
- Cost/latency — what is the cost signature trending? (healthy: stable or declining)

# Root Cause Isolation

Identify the architectural flaw, not the textual symptom:

- Too many responsibilities
- Hidden priority conflicts
- Unbounded reasoning depth
- Contradictory safety conditions
- Surface area too large
- Examples that subtly bias
- Knowledge baked in (should be retrieved)

# Surface Area Reduction

1. Delete tone/voice/style instructions (unless core to task)
2. Extract compliance/safety into separate prompts
3. Remove redundancy and accumulated contradictions
