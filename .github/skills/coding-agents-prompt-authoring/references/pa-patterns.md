<patterns mix-and-match="any">

<multi-hypothesis>

- Define top 3-5 best solutions, ideas, etc.
- Work on each independently
- Select winner or merge
- Clearly indicate and store separately alternatives

</multi-hypothesis>

<requirements-and-intent>

- Requirements could be reverse engineered, a must if starting from something existing
- "Interrogate" user to get requirements using questioning.md skill
- Persist the intent and pass it across entire workflow
- Clearly define which requirements are directly provided by users and which were deducted by AI
- Ensure original requirements and intent is always verified with through out the entire process as source of truth

</requirements-and-intent>

<authoring-review-via-annotations>

- AI generates file
- User reviews and leaves annotations / comments
- AI fixes the file according to annotations removing them
- Cycle repeats, but define clear exit conditions
- User still must explicitly approve to proceed, do not assume it was done

</authoring-review-via-annotations>

<discovery-research>

- Discovery: find project context
- Research: find common and specialized knowledge online
- Result: a summarized relevant index of references and patterns

</discovery-research>

<review-after-authoring>

- Critically review new or modified content
- Loop original agent to consider review comments, but take it as recommendations
- Use separate models for authoring and reviewing
- MUST limit number of loops and prevent nitpicking

</review-after-authoring>

<memory-self-learning>

- Use simple format
- Keep memory organized, very concise
- Grep by headers for auto-toc
- Define step to autoload using grep
- Use persisted file to save execution status in FEATURE PLAN folder
- Save decisions, things tried, successes and failures, hypothesis to prevent looping (include role who wrote what)
- Identify the true root cause of every failure or missed expectation, convert it into a reusable preventive rule, and store it in memory.
- Usage: task memory TASK-MEMORY.md in FEATURE PLAN folder and AGENT MEMORY
- Do not mix levels, and explain to not mix levels: task memory is request-scoped, project memory stores reusable repository rules
- Prefer agent memory over task memory

</memory-self-learning>

<ralph-loop>

- Create task memory
- Execute (using task memory)
- Review results of execute (using task memory)
- Update task memory with root cause analysis for failure, add, change, or remove generalized rule, be reasonable - do not change a lot introducing chaos
- Loop again to execute

</ralph-loop>

<layering-cognitive-space>

- Architect makes high-level decisions, actors, responsibilities, contracts, inputs/outputs
- Planner breaks down work into process
- Engineer implements tasks according to plan and design
- Etc.

</layering-cognitive-space>

<draft-improve-aspect-based>

- Start with short draft with core intent and principles (draft)
- Improve one or another aspect
- Aspects must not be conflicting
- Dependent aspects must be properly sequenced
- Pipeline of adding value

</draft-improve-aspect-based>

<subagents-orchestration>

- Provide clear concise role with knowledge for subagent to assume as first sentence of the input
- Provide clear task, considering that subagent has no your context, use SMART at minimum
- Provide context or references (better) for lightweight agents to be successful, including all relevant files, all types of prompts that are required to effectively complete the work, instruct to NOT do more than requested
- Provide context or references (better), only mention to complete prep steps, so that you both rely on common knowledge, tell exact phases, steps, and tasks to do (but do not explain), SMART, DRY, KISS is minimum, instruct to NOT do more than requested
- Large inputs: write input to a file in FEATURE TEMP folder, reference as MUST to auto-toc grep and read, critical requirements go first in the file
- Large output: provide exact path to folder where to put output files inside FEATURE TEMP folder, if output is not part of the contract, tell subagent exactly what file name, format, and minimal template it should use
- Let subagents read and write common files (be careful for parallel agents modifying the same file)
- Copy-before-write could be used, but many changed copies will be even bigger problem
- You can use addendum approach (where subagent only outputs what should be modified)
- Enforce subagent is focused, in case if something goes off the plan, it must tell caller agent back, instead of trying to continue (critical!)
- Ensure subagents are organized the way they have minimal state transition
- The best orchestrator "trusts, but validates", "Idiot-proofing" processes, applies Poka-yoke, proactively fights "if something could go wrong will go wrong", properly applies both "theory X and theory Y" at the same time, etc.

</subagents-orchestration>

<slicing-large-list-of-rules>

- Prepare the full list of rules
- Slice rules with small intersection across layers, aspects, and actors

</slicing-large-list-of-rules>

<review-and-validate>

- Review IS statically reviewing some result for some intent (its output maybe wrong)
- Validate IS actually running it on sample or real tasks locally (this provides great insights, rarely wrong, but more expensive)

</review-and-validate>

<why-vs-how-loops>

- There is "WHY" loop: idea → requirements → working software → learn → evolve idea
- There is "HOW" loop: specs → code → tests → stories → features

- Combinations:
  1. Humans outside the loop: human runs WHY, agent runs HOW autonomously. Agents use requirements. Good: fast, humans focus on outcomes. Bad: agents spiral on messy code, external quality hard to guarantee.
  2. Humans in the loop: human gatekeeps every artefact in HOW loop. Good: human judgement breaks agent spirals fast. Bad: human becomes bottleneck, review time can exceed generation savings.
  3. Humans on the loop: human builds the harness (specs, checks, workflow) that controls HOW loop, agent runs within it. Good: scales judgement, improvements compound. Bad: upfront investment, new discipline. Key: fix the harness, not the artefact.
  4. Agentic flywheel: human directs agents to improve the harness itself using test results, prod metrics, user data. Good: self-improving, anti-fragile. Bad: needs high confidence and rich signals first.

- Key Points:
  1. Internal quality matters not for its own sake — messy code makes agents spiral, costing time and money.
  2. Intermediate artifacts (code, tests, designs) are means to an end, not deliverables.
  3. When output is wrong, fix the harness that produced it, not the artifact itself.

- We are at HITL, but move towards AF.

</why-vs-how-loops>

<problem-solution-proof>

- Use self-documentation to make rational decisions afterwards
- Save what problem this artifact is solving
- Document concisely solution for a problem
- Write retrospectively and introspectively validation proof that this problem is actually solved by the artifact
- If you see it is NOT or partially solved - document what should be done

</problem-solution-proof>

<validation>

- Validate outputs/inputs/statements as those might be partially correct, incomplete, or overstating
- Build solid foundation then build next layer
- Sequence dependencies. Example: change database => validate database => implement API instead of change database => implement API
- Validate by actually executing on what was built (example: run backend code and test API with curl, etc.)
- Build agentic harness to validate what was built (example: build cli to test library/package or to access external systems, etc.)

</validation>

<work-curiosity-limit>

- Intentionally limit AI to not do more or extra work and maintain boundaries
- Intentionally limit AI to not discover or research more unless absolutely necessary
- Intentionally make AI to trust the system
- Focus on the task itself
- limit AI context overflow and eagerness to do everything at once
- Curiosity ends with discover, research, and architecture

</work-curiosity-limit>

<self-organizing>

- When files become large
- Maintain auto-toc by use of grep-able
- Compress old and not useful information
- Reorganize folder structure if growing

</self-organizing>

<simulation>

- Instead of directly answering, think how it will work in reality
- Define few use cases
- Identify what will be in context and state at each time, what is cognitive load
- Identify how to build gradually value increasing iterative pipeline
- Distribute logic across phases so each phase only carries the principles that govern THAT phase's work
- The artifacts between phases are the key as they carry conclusions forward without carrying instructions forward
- JUST EXAMPLE: Intake → Architect → Draft → Hardening/Review → Simulation → Final Consistency → Validate

</simulation>

<human-issues>

- User just cannot provide all inputs in a consistent manner in one shot
- AI should proactively solicit requirement and verify it is coherent
- User my provide conflicting, unspecific, ambiguous, subjective qualifiers, vague adjectives and constructs, loaded expressions
- AI should reconstruct it as coherent simple clear consistent SET of requirements without gaps
- Ask questions until crystal clear without nitpicking
- User can only REVIEW maximum 2 pages of simple text, and this does NOT limit result which could be much larger
- User appreciates TLDR and similar

</human-issues>

<ai-issues>

- System prompts (out of our control) require immediate execution, deny back-and-forth with user, also models always jump to conclusions
- Our prompts should encourage co-working and co-authoring
- AI forgets to give proper context, forgets that subagents, tool calls outputs are only available to orchestrator, user can not see those, etc.
- AI forgets to validate, reorganize, persist root causes, learn (persist discovered knowledge), and cleanup
- AI mixes intent, aspects, actors, sequence of events, independent facts, consequences vs prerequisites, and responsibilities if not clearly separated
- AI is prone to carry away and generate a huge amounts of content based on assumptions, rendering it useless or impossible to review
- AI overly relies on internal knowledge (but train sets are >1Y old), AI does not proactively research
- AI removes important clarifiers, specifiers, explanations ("just", "only", "constantly", minor explanations, etc)
- AI constantly keeps inserting non-operational clarifications (history, rationale, origin labels, change annotations), but target documents must be source-agnostic, state-only, action-only. All change logs must be directed to a separate file.
- AI constantly badly over-engineers instead of simplifying, simplification is a king
- AI constantly brings new ideas instead of following existing, constantly overly complicates
- AI never looks around to think "What else is used? What could be the better solution? How this pattern or issue was resolved in other places? What web search can find? What else is affected in any direction?"
- AI prioritizes action over analysis leading to not known unknowns
- AI needs harsh, direct, MoSCoW style rules + short brilliant comparisons (task coded ≠ task completed, trust but verify)
- AI produces an unmanageable amount of AI generated content with a lot of non-matching assumptions (AI slop)
- AI "feels overloaded" and skips steps if we provide more than 5 at once
- AI constantly injects instructions/reasoning/information given to him into final outputs, even though those for its own reasoning only (examples: AI makes mistakes - user tells to fix because of X - AI applies correct fix and additionally adds that X to the final document - instead of just fixing - producing useless slop; AI reads requirements and specifications - implements changes - internal requirement identifiers slip in output to user; etc.)

</ai-issues>

<visual_graph>

- Proactively ask to generate and show a graph visually, also suggest which perspectives to generate it on
- Load and process source data programmatically or AI-driven semi-programmatically to build a graph data
- Use GitNexus for coding graph or Graphviz to build/show the UI for any graph and configure it for best visual presentation

</visual_graph>
