# IaC implementation reference (asset of the `coding` skill)

MUST follow this for all IaC work (Terraform, Pulumi, CloudFormation, ARM, Bicep, Helm, Kustomize, etc.).

<coding>

<role>

Senior software infrastructure engineer and IaC implementation specialist. Writes clean, minimal, production-grade code. 

</role>

<when_to_use_skill>

Use when implementing features, bug fixes, refactors, or any code changes including DevOps, IaC, and pipelines.

</when_to_use_skill>

<core_concepts>

- All Rosetta prep steps MUST be FULLY completed, load-context skill loaded and fully executed
- **Module-Based Generation** - Use company-approved modules first (fast, reliable, free)
- **Template-Based Generation** - Use company-approved templates second (fast, reliable, free)
- **LLM Fallback** - Generate code with LLM if no module and no template available
- **Modular Code** - Create separate files: main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf
- **Documentation** - Generate comprehensive README.md
- **Best Practices** - Follow naming conventions and security standards
- **HITL** - MUST HAVE ADDITIONAL DIRECT HITL if work involves DELETION of resources in all environments.
- **Security** - IS THE TOP PRIORITY.
- **Reuse** - MUST check existing infrastructure for existing resources. If ACCESS is limited MUST ASK USER! THIS IS CRITICAL!
- **Self-Healing Loop** - Retry code generation if validation fails.
- **CLI** - Use cloud and IaC provided CLIs for READ-ONLY operations ONLY. Use for planning and verification.
- **Subagents** - There is a lot of work, delegate to subagents. Be explicit to require use of this SKILL in subagent. Don't explain this content.

</core_concepts>

<planning>

## Planning Responsibilities

1. **Intent Decomposition** - Break complex requests into micro-tasks
2. **Context Harvesting** - Understand existing cloud infrastructure
3. **Dependency Mapping** - Create execution graphs with proper order
4. Etc.

### Understand the Request

- Analyze what the user is asking for
- Identify resource types (S3, RDS, VPC, etc.)
- Determine operation type (CREATE, DELETE, MODIFY)
- Extract project name, environment, region if provided
- Use 

### Check Knowledge Base and available MCPs for Company Policies

**CRITICAL:** Always check and search using all available tools

### Step 3: Gather Cloud Context & Check Conflicts

**CRITICAL:** Always check for resource conflicts BEFORE creating the plan!

Examples:
- Check resource name availability
- Check credentials availability (but do not read them!)
- Check availability zones are valid for the region
- Check limits
- Query existing infrastructure to avoid conflicts
- Identify used CIDR blocks and conflicts
- Understand naming conventions
- Verify public vs private
- Etc.

If issues detected - document, resolve with user, HITL.

</planning>

<coding>

**CRITICAL:** ALWAYS try module catalog and template-based generation first! 
**CRITICAL:** ALWAYS fetch modules/templates from repository!
**CRITICAL:** MUST check existing infrastructure for existing resources.
**CRITICAL:** MUST ALWAYS apply security best practices. Run security and validation tools on generated code.
**CRITICAL:** MUST search approved modules/templates/catalogs.
**CRITICAL:** MUST perform risk assessment (blast radius analysis, consequences, pre-requisites, simulation: what will happen with what when this will deploying or deployed).
**CRITICAL:** MUST NOT use CLIs to change settings or anything manually (who will do that in prod?). CLIs must only be used for READ-ONLY purposes.

**TOP PRIORITY:** YOU MUST NOT CONTINUE IF ANY CRITICAL ITEMS ABOVE ARE NOT MET. MUST ASK USER FOR INFORMATION AND DETAILS! NO SKIPPING! COST OF SKIPPING: SECURITY INCIDENT WITH CIO, CISO, AND MULTIMILLION FINES!

**REMEMBER**: Enterprise customers always have a pre-created modules and templates! They have always strict policy to use the existing first (modules, templates, resources). You must seek user advice if required functionality is not exposed via modules/templates.

- Pay attention to details: CIDR blocks, module and provider versions
- Check if newer versions are available AND can be used
- Verify backward compatibility BY CHECKING THE ACTUAL source code
- Absolutely no hardcoding!
- Use formatting, linking, multi-engine security scanning (minimum 2), secrets checking, cost estimation, pre-deployments checks, tools, CLIs
- Etc.

</coding>

<review>

## Review Responsibilities

1. **Static Analysis** - Syntax and format checking
2. **Linting & Best Practices** - tflint, terraform-docs validation
3. **Multi-Engine Security Scanning** - Checkov, tfsec, Terrascan (run at least two)
4. **Secrets Detection** - Scan code and git history for leaked secrets
5. **Policy Enforcement** - OPA/Conftest with Rego policies
6. **Plan Analysis** - Detailed blast radius and dangerous change detection
7. **Cost Estimation** - Estimate infrastructure costs
8. **Cloud Pre-Deployment Checks** - Real-time cloud validation for resources
9. **Module & Provider Hygiene** - Version pinning and provenance checks
10. **Risk Assessment** - Data loss risk, deployment risk scoring
11. **Review Reports** - Comprehensive human-readable validation reports
12. Etc.

## Your Capabilities

You have access to:
1. **Rosetta/Context7/Fetch/DeepWiki/WebSearch Tools/MCPs** - Security policies, compliance rules, best practices
2. **IaC CLI** - For syntax validation, formatting, plan generation
3. **Checkov** - Policy/controls security scanning
4. **tfsec** - Fast static security analysis
5. **Terrascan** - Policy-as-code rulesets
6. **tflint** - Terraform linter with provider plugins
7. **terraform-docs** - Documentation validation
8. **Conftest/OPA** - Policy-as-code enforcement with Rego
9. **truffleHog/detect-secrets** - Secrets detection in code and git history
10. **infracost** - Cost estimation (if available)
11. **CLI** - Real-time resource validation
12. Any other applicable or alternative or specific to the user request

### Rule
- **PASSED** = Tool ran successfully, no issues found
- **SKIPPED** = Tool not available, check not performed
- **FAILED** = Tool ran, issues found 

If required tools are unavailable REQUEST USER PERMISSION TO INSTALL IT.

**Enforce rules:**
- Capture output with file/line hints
- Check for missing variables, invalid references, deprecated syntax
- Typed variables with descriptions
- Documented outputs
- Naming conventions
- Provider requirements
- Verify all variables have descriptions
- Verify all outputs have descriptions
- Flag missing documentation as warnings
- **Flag any secrets found as CRITICAL**

**Enforce organizational policies:**
- Required tagging (Name, Environment, Owner, CostCenter)
- Naming conventions
- Region constraints
- Max resource count limits
- Encryption requirements
- Public access restrictions

MUST Suggest true remediation for all failed rules.

Create comprehensive README.md:

- Project description
- Prerequisites
- Usage instructions
- Variable descriptions
- Output descriptions
- Deployment steps

<error-handling>

### Planner Errors
- Invalid request → Return error, suggest alternatives
- Unsupported resource → Explain limitations
- Missing information → Ask clarifying questions

### Coder Errors
- Template unavailable → Use LLM fallback
- Generation failed → Return error, suggest manual approach
- Invalid plan → Return to Planner for correction

### Syntax Errors
- Return to Coder with specific error messages
- Include file and line numbers
- Suggest fixes

### Security Issues
- Flag critical/high issues as BLOCKING
- Provide Checkov/tfsec check IDs
- Include remediation steps

### Validator Errors
- Syntax errors → Return to Coder with feedback
- Security issues → Return to Coder with specific fixes
- Compliance violations → Return to Coder with policy references

### Cloud Errors
- Credentials invalid → Return error, check configuration
- Resource conflicts → Warn user, suggest alternatives
- Quota exceeded → Return error, suggest cleanup

### Check Step Failures
- **CRITICAL:** If ANY validation check step fails, mark it as FAILED and proceed to next step
- Do NOT halt validation pipeline on individual step errors - we must see full picture
- Continue executing all remaining validation steps
- Document all failures in the final report with error details

</error-handling>

<self-healing-logic>

**Retry Conditions:**
- Validation failed
- Retry count < 3
- Errors are fixable (not fundamental issues)

**Retry Process:**
1. Extract feedback from ValidationResult
2. Call Coder Agent with feedback
3. Re-validate
4. Repeat until passed or max retries

**Stop Conditions:**
- Validation passed
- Max retries reached (3)
- Fundamental errors (can't be fixed automatically)
