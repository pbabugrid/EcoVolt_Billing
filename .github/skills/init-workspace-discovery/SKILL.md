<role>
Senior workspace cartographer — fast, factual technical inventory.
</role>

<when_to_use_skill>

Without factual inventory of tech stack, structure, and dependencies, subsequent phases operate blind. Use during workspace initialization or when TECHSTACK, CODEMAP, or DEPENDENCIES are missing or stale.

</when_to_use_skill>

<process>

1. All Rosetta prep steps MUST be FULLY completed, load-context skill loaded and fully executed
2. Read existing TECHSTACK, CODEMAP, DEPENDENCIES — update if present, create if missing
3. Detect languages, frameworks, build tools, package managers, runtime environments → write TECHSTACK
4. Existing documentation may be stale or incomplete, prioritize source code artifacts over pre-existing documents
5. Generate CODEMAP via shell commands (no pseudo graphics), 3-4 levels deep
   - Perform basic discovery yourself with few commands
   - Enumerate git repositories yourself
   - Markdown headers = workspace-relative path + recursive children count + <10 words description
   - List only immediate children files and only with file names
   - List target repository source code, static assets, and documentation files based on tech stack
   - Exclude noise/caches/build/binary files, files excluded by .gitignore
   - Implement as a single shell script in `agents/TEMP/` folder
   - Use `git ls-files --cached --others --exclude-standard` in each repository or fallback to find/ls/etc with filters
6. List direct dependencies (project, package, version) → write DEPENDENCIES
7. Preserve human-added sections in existing files
8. Update (or create only if missing) .gitignore in git root folder by adding lines according to bootstrap_rosetta_files
   Minimal set must be present:
   ```
   ...
   # Rosetta
   agents/TEMP/
   refsrc/
   !refsrc/INDEX.md
   ```

</process>

<files>

# DEPENDENCIES.md

- MUST create, use, and maintain flat list of direct project dependencies (project, package, version)

# TECHSTACK.md

- MUST create, use, and maintain project stack and key stack decisions

# CODEMAP.md

- MUST create, use, and maintain list folders and files within the code base
- Contains 3-4 levels deep folder structure
- Markdown headers = workspace-relative path + recursive children count + <10 words description
- Lists only immediate children files and only with file names

</files>

<pitfalls>

- Keep only current state — no deltas, no changelogs, no update reasons, no changes explanations, no summaries, the shorter the better.

Example scripts provided (think if you want to use it, as those are very large, 20K each, use ACQUIRE FROM KB command to load):

- `init-workspace-discovery/scripts/codemap.ps1.txt` 
- `init-workspace-discovery/scripts/codemap.sh.txt` 

NOTE: `.txt` extension is added to avoid execution or treating as executable.
