<process>

On failure or mismatch:

1. STOP all changes immediately.
2. Identify root cause — not symptoms.
3. Ask 1-3 clarifying questions if ambiguous.
4. State understanding and conflicts in brief bullets.
5. Wait for explicit user confirmation.

Memory:

6. Consult AGENT MEMORY.md during planning.
7. Init if missing; prefer agent memory over task memory.
8. Convert root causes into GENERALIZED, REUSABLE preventive rules — not incident-specific notes.
9. Store in AGENT MEMORY.md concisely and organized.
10. Record what worked and failed logically, architecturally, and technically.

</process>

<pitfalls>

- Fixing the artifact instead of the harness that produced it.
- Storing incident notes instead of generalizable rules.
